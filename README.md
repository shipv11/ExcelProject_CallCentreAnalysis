# ExcelProject_CallCentreAnalysis
In this Excel Project, we analyse Call centre data. We prepare the data for dashboarding by doing the needed calculations in the Calcs sheet. We then pull through a few calculations on the dashboard sheet just to make things easier. We then make our dashboard using conditional formatting, sparklines, gauge chart, doughnut chart, data validation, and scroll bar.
